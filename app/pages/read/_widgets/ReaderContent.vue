			[Author’s note: An early explanation here: This book’s genre is not online gaming!
			Not infinite element genre [1]! And most certainly not transmigration to another
			world! All I can say is that this is a fantasy novel set amidst a modern backdrop…
			As for the specifics, you will know once you read on. [Once again, this is not an
			online gaming novel!] Severe vibrations, followed by a long period of
			darkness-filled state of unconsciousness. After that, light began to appear, bit by
			bit. Chen Xiaolian’s seemingly regained consciousness . However, he was only
			slightly conscious. Forcing himself to open his eyes, he saw what appeared to be
			flashes of pictures… appearing intermittently as though they were fragments. It
			seemed as though… they had landed… The cockpit’s door was opened… The “I wish you
			good luck” pilot came out… Chen Xiaolian’s mind and consciousness was still in a
			state of disorder and he could not maintain a clear head. The one clear thought he
			had was… I, am probably still alive, right? However, he then ‘saw’ a fragment of
			flashing pictures that did not seem right! The “I wish you good luck” pilot suddenly
			tore off the pilot uniform that he was wearing. That was right, he tore it off! It
			was as though what he tore off were not clothes, but mere paper! That cannot be
			right! How could normal people have that much strength? Clothes may not seem too
			durable, however, have you tried to tear it off before? Could you simply tear it off
			as though it were mere paper? After that… As the buzzing sound within Chen
			Xiaolian’s ears had yet to subside, he could only catch part of what was being said.
			The other person seemed to be shouting… “Begin formation of teams…” “… equipment…
			pathfinder…” “… dungeon quest…” Chen Xiaolian finally became certain of one thing,
			he must be dreaming! I played too much games and now my mind is in a state of
			confusion, right? Then… he thoroughly fainted, again. [Author’s note: An early
